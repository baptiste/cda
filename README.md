# cda package

Coupled-dipole simulations for electromagnetic scattering of light by
sub-wavelength particles in arbitrary 3-dimensional configurations.
Scattering and absorption spectra are simulated by inversion of the
interaction matrix, or by an order-of-scattering approximation scheme.
High-level functions are provided to simulate spectra with varying
angles of incidence, as well as with full angular averaging.
