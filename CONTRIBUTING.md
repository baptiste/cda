# Guidelines for issues and requests

Thank you for using the `cda` package! Please read through these notes before submitting a request. This will increase the chances of a useful response.

## Issues related with installation or basic R syntax

If the issue is not directly related to the `cda` package, this is not the best place to discuss it.
If you need help with the R language, I suggest you ask a question on [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/), with a minimal reproducible example. Reading the []*Introduction to R*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html) manual may also be helpful.
