Title: Coupled dipole approximation in electromagnetic scattering
Description: Solves the electromagnetic problem of coupled-dipoles (scattering
    and absorption by a cluster of subwavelength particles in arbitrary 3D
    configuration) by direct inversion of the interaction matrix. Functions are
    provided for linear polarisation with varying angle of incidence, as well
    as circular polarisation with angular averaging (optical activity).
    Retardation is included in the interaction.
