# cda package

Coupled-dipole simulations for electromagnetic scattering of light by sub-wavelength particles in arbitrary 3-dimensional configurations. Scattering and absorption spectra are simulated by inversion of the interaction matrix, or by an order-of-scattering approximation scheme. High-level functions are provided to simulate spectra with varying angles of incidence, as well as with full angular averaging.
