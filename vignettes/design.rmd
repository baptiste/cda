Design considerations for the CDA package
========================================================


## Functions

CDA

* `block_diagonal(const arma::cx_colvec& Beta, const arma::mat& Euler)`

* `interaction_matrix(const arma::mat& R, const double kn,
  			const arma::cx_colvec& Beta, const arma::mat& Euler, 
				const int full)`
* ``

## Minimal code in R

## Structure of the core components

Simulated spectra are obtained for a vector of wavelengths, with length Nlambda, and a cluster size N.

* Wavelength-dependent values

Beta is a matrix of size 3N x Nlambda (rows x columns). It is passed to xxx_spectrum functions at the cpp level, and is passed one row at a time to the functions operating one wavelength at a time.

      beta = reshape(Beta.row(ll), 3, Nr, 1); 

Not true, change this without reshaping beta every time

Integrate diagonal into main A function and don't build a useless matrix


------

Beta is 3N x Nlambda
Euler is 3xN matrix
R is a 3xN matrix
Angle is a 3xN matrix
Axis is a 3xN matrix

-----

beta is Beta.col(ii)
block diagonal becomes
trans(Euler.col(ii)) * diagmat(beta(jj:jj+3)) * Euler.col(ii)



* Diagonal blocks

* Interaction matrix
