* fix Module loading from Rcpp

* test examples

* refactor averaging and cd_spectrum to switch between two functions

* polarisability port to c++, higher-level function for fast optimization

* check that the polarisability is passed from R to C++ in the best shape to avoid unnecessary transformations.

* find/write an iterative solver for the CDA equations, e.g qmr, gmres, CG etc.

* solve multiple angles at once using solve(A, B) where B is a matrix of incident fields.
